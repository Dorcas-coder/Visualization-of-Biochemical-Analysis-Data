# Visualization of Biochemical Analysis Data
The Repository shows the visualization of the cognitive behavior study of biochemical analysis data. The study was conducted through animal sampling.
## Overview  
This project focuses on the visualization of biochemical analysis data.  
The aim is to present laboratory and biochemical measurements in a clear and easy-to-understand way using charts and plots.

Data visualization helps to quickly identify patterns, trends, and differences in biochemical results that may not be obvious from raw tables.

## Objectives  
The main goals of this project are to:

- Load and organize biochemical analysis data  
- Explore key biochemical parameters  
- Visualize measurements using simple charts  
- Make complex data easier to understand  
- Support basic scientific interpretation through visuals
  
## Dataset  
- **Type:** Biochemical analysis data  
- **Content may include:**  
  - Laboratory test results  
  - Concentration levels of biochemical substances  
  - Sample or experiment identifiers  

> Note: This project is for educational and research practice purposes.

## Tools and Technologies  
The project uses:

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - Pandas for handling data  
  - NumPy for basic calculations  
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## Methodology  
The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Import biochemical data into Python  

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Check for missing values  
   - Organize data into useful formats  

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Review summary statistics  
   - Compare measurements across samples  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts  
   - Line plots  
   - Histograms  
   - Simple comparison plots 

## Key Outputs  

The project produces:

- Clear visual summaries of biochemical measurements  
- Charts that highlight differences and trends  
- Easy-to-interpret graphical results  

All outputs are available in the Jupyter Notebook and the visuals folder.

## How to Run This Project  

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project folder:
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
4. Run the notebook cells in order.
   
## Use Cases  
This project can be useful for:
- Students learning scientific data visualization  
- Beginners practicing Python visualization  
- Researchers exploring biochemical data visually  
- Anyone interested in presenting lab results clearly  

## Limitations  
- The analysis focuses on visualization, not prediction  
- Interpretation depends on the quality of the input data  
- Results should not replace professional laboratory analysis 

## Future Improvements  
Possible future work includes:

- Adding more advanced visualizations  
- Comparing multiple experiments or datasets  
- Automating report generation  
- Integrating basic statistical testing
